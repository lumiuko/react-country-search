## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) - For transitions
- [react-content-loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader) - For "skeletons" while loading

### What I learned

Pretty much about React itself (JSX, components, hooks, state, etc), working with APIs and styling using SCSS.

### Continued development

In my future React projects I want to learn and use Styled Components.
